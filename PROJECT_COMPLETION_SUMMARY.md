## 🆘 Help & Support

### Check First
1. ✅ Error messages (read carefully)
2. ✅ verify_setup.py (run to diagnose)
3. ✅ Documentation files (answers are there)
4. ✅ Original repo issues (others may have same problem)

### Common Solutions
- **Out of memory**: Reduce BATCH_SIZE
- **TensorFlow errors**: Use pip install tensorflow==2.10.0
