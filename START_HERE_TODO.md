# 🎯 YOUR TODO LIST - START HERE!

## Current Status: SETUP COMPLETE, EXECUTION NEEDED

### ✅ Done For You:
- Project structure created
- All scripts and tools ready
- Documentation complete
- Everything is set up

### ❌ What YOU Need to Do:

## STEP 1: Install Dependencies (15-30 minutes)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**What this does:** Installs TensorFlow, Librosa, and all required packages

**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE (run verify_setup.py - shows packages missing)

---

## STEP 2: Get Dataset (1-3 hours)
**Choose ONE option:**

### Option A: Download Pre-prepared (RECOMMENDED)
- Download: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eiRYFSOqBTPAJabmzAV5s0pQaqCE-OVg/view?usp=sharing
- Extract to project root
- **Status:** ❌ NOT DONE

### Option B: Use Your Own Audio
- Place .wav files in Dataset/Source/Train/Voice/
- Place .wav files in Dataset/Source/Train/Noise/<category>/
- **Status:** ❌ NOT DONE

---

## STEP 3: Prepare Data (30-60 minutes)
```bash
python prepare_data.py
```
**What this does:** Processes audio files, mixes voice+noise, creates spectrograms

**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE (no .h5 file exists yet)

---

## STEP 4: Train Model (6-24 hours)
```bash
python train_model.py
```
**What this does:** Trains the deep learning model

**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE (no model weights exist yet)

---

## STEP 5: Test/Predict (30 minutes)
```bash
python prediction_denoise.py
```
**What this does:** Tests the model, generates denoised audio

**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE

---

## STEP 6: Write Report (3-5 days)
- Use PROJECT_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md
- Fill in your results
- Add analysis

**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE

---

## STEP 7: Create Presentation (2-3 days)
- Use PRESENTATION_OUTLINE.md
- Create slides
- Prepare demo

**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE

## 🎯 START NOW!

### Today (Right Now):
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (do this first!)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Verify it worked
python verify_setup.py

# 3. Read the getting started guide
cat GETTING_STARTED.md
```

### This Week:
- Get dataset
- Run data preparation
- Start training

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT:

**THE PROJECT IS NOT "DONE" UNTIL:**
1. ✅ Model is trained
2. ✅ Results are generated
3. ✅ Report is written
4. ✅ Presentation is ready
5. ✅ Everything works and you can demo it

**Right now:** You have a well-organized, ready-to-use project structure.
**But:** No actual work has been executed yet.

## 💡 Quick Answer to Your Question:

**Q: Is the project completed?**

**A: NO, but it's ready to be completed!**

- Setup phase: ✅ 100% done
- Execution phase: ❌ 0% done
- **You need to run the code and generate results**

---

## 🚀 Next Action (DO THIS NOW):

```bash
# Step 1: Install packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# This takes 10-15 minutes
# Then you can proceed to get dataset
```

**After that, follow GETTING_STARTED.md step by step!**

---

**Remember:** Having the tools ≠ Completing the project
You need to USE the tools to get results!
